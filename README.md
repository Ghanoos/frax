## What Does Frax Do?
Frax is still in it's early development stages, so there should be a lot of bugs or issues.
Right now, Frax is able to perform these actions:
* Define Pi, as [Pi](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Pi) (You can call it whenever you need it.)
* Define Phi, as [Phi](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Phi) (You can call it whenever you need it.)
* Add [Log()](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Log()-Function) function.
* Add [logt()](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Logt()-Function) function.
* Add [times()](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Times()-Function) function.
* Includes basic useful libraries. [List of Used Libraries](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Used-Libraries)

## To-Do List
Here is a list what I plan to add in the future.

- [x] Add log function
- [x] Add More Libraries
- [x] Add Time Function
- [ ] Add TrueRandom (In beta)
- [ ] Clean up the code

## How to use Frax?
1. To use FRAX, first, you'll need a C++ app. It can be whatever, it doesn't matter.
2. On the first line, put `#include "frax.h"`.
3. Download Frax.h file.
4. Copy it to your app's directory.
5. Done! try to see if it works by putting `log("Hello World");` inside your main() function.
6. Enjoy! If you found any issue, feel free to share it with my via GitHub's built in "Issues" section.
