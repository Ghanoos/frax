## What Does Frax Do?
Frax is still in it's early development stages, so there should be a lot of bugs or issues.
Right now, Frax is able to perform these actions:
* Define Pi, as [Pi](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Pi) (You can call it whenever you need it.)
* Define Phi, as [Phi](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Phi) (You can call it whenever you need it.)
* Add [Log()](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Log()-Function) function.
* Add [logt()](https://github.com/mohsenemx/frax/wiki/Logt()-Function) function.
* Includes basic useful libraries. [List of Used Libraries]()
